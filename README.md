## A Brief Introduction about Time series analysis

### Abstract
We know computer software and its applications are increasing day by day. As the result the usage of servers also increases proportionally.In this project we propose a user activity at various intervals of time that can help in identifying the best time for maintaining the various software's.
  
### Background
Having better customer experience is always the top priorities for any IT Solutions. It involves providing new features,bug fixes to the solution regularly by updating new software. This activity should be carried out without impacting or with minimal impact to users. Generally, in cloud native solutions, it is achieved by providing High Availability features, Redundant deployments (Blue and Green deployments). Continuous deployments, as a new Agile DevOps model, refers to provide new features and bug fixes in frequent intervals. A figure explaining the user traffic activity of the users is given. In figure \ref{fig:cloud services}(a) from the image we can see that people accessing the site from different accessories and the data is continuously being updated from time to time to understand the requirement.Cloud devops is a new technology which is mainly responsible for efficient development operations that can balance service reliability and the delivery speed as the features are also so high we can actually get the required amount of data we actually required and note ..this is simple an basic example of our daily life we can take a thermometer in thermometer we get the temperature data and the data is taken in similar manner we are trying to get system health data 
<br/>
  
  ### Problem Addressed
  Cloud operations team would need to decide on maintenance windows, and these should be the times, with zero impact to the business. Predicting the possible maintenance windows early, would enable Cloud Operations team to plan and execute solution updates with Zero business impact.In Multi-tenant solution, a prediction of minimal impact periods should consider all the Customers using the solution. user activity monitoring is very important.The system provides the task the user is engaged in. It also activates the the task in any accessory the user wants to open . for example we have gmail we can access it in laptop as well as mobile phone and all the mails that we receive and obtain both are updated and monitored in all the accessories the user has. With this we need to check the traffic analysis which is the process of monitoring and accessing the data in the form of communication. it is also much concerned about the computer security Network Traffic Analysis tools collect the real-time and historical records of the network. It can help you to detect malware such as ransomware activity. It detects the use of vulnerable protocols and ciphers. ... All the network analysis tools don't collect the flow data and packet data coming from different sources.
  
  ### Related Work
  Tools like App dynamics are used previously by authors it is one the most quick  increasing technology among which these are few part of the valuation and prediction . It continuous to secure all the data of the previous and new that is being obtained to the company , It is responsible for consistent user experience as well as time.Many companies uses this strategy and experienced success in their work. The advantages are like it has a strong security to hold the data and the clients will have a strong satisfaction in the high standard implementation processes.It is very scalable ,well integrated and performs very well in their process.
  
  ### Method
  Business Activity Metrics, BAM, provides insights into user activity distribution and ML model is proposed to learn the occurrences of user traffic, time of the day, day of the week and predict the probable time periods that would be available for maintenance. Cloud Ops team can benefit from these predictions and schedule the down time  accordingly, Business Activity Metrics can be collected from Monitoring applications (eg Datadog) or Cloud Solution Analytics (eg. CCaaS Analytics) for a long duration, say 6 months of data to train the Model, while continue to learn during operations and provide predictions.There we are creating a micro service which must be a service oriented architecture where the tasks are performed by itself and later it can be updated using ml modelling.A sample model is taken. Here it shows the steps how the process is going on in the testing. The data from different data sets will be of different sizes. Therefore, we have to collect only the required data to a standard data as the pre-processing step before giving it to the model to reduce the chance of errors. Then, this pre-processed data should be service oriented and the micro service should be in the state-of-art. from the sample design we can understand the process of how a unit start from different accessories through the internet and the data goes to a unit called server and m.l modelling can be done.
  
  ### Data Set 
  Presently we have used a Dummy data we can furthuer implement by taking the real time values from the company
  
  ### Results
  These predictions will be compared with actual user traffic and corrected. over a period of time 90 percent of accurate prediction.the data will be continuously being  monitored.and for different web servers there is different traffic and requirement and user activity so we have to check according to the requirement.
